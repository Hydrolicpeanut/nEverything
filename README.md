## Description

This project extends the classic N-Queens problem to a more generalized version where the user can specify any number of different chess pieces and their quantities, along with the size of the chessboard. The goal is to place the specified pieces on the board in such a way that no two pieces can attack each other. The solution utilizes recursion and backtracking to explore possible configurations and Java Swing and AWT for visualizing the chessboard and the placement of pieces.

#### Technologies

- Java Swing
- Java AWT
